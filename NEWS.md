# development 

- `"covers"` containment mode is now supported
- `to_cells()` is renamed `sfc_to_cells()`
- h3o dependency is bumped to version 0.4.0
- `sfc_to_cells()` gets a new argument `containment` based off of the [`ContainmentMode` enum](https://docs.rs/h3o/0.4.0/h3o/geom/enum.ContainmentMode.html) 

# h3o 0.2.0

- Adds a `wk::wk_handler` function for conversion to sfc, geos, s2, and other types that implement the handler.
- New functionality: `to_cells()` to convert an `sfc` object to H3 cells. 
- Refactors Rust code to avoid collecting into `List`s to prevent Stack Overflow bug. 
- Bumps h3o version to 0.3.5 to get speed and memory enhancements. 

# h3o 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
