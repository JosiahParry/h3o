#' Grid Traversal
#'
#' Functions used to traverse the H3 grid.
#'
#' @param x an `H3` vector.
#' @param y an `H3` vector.
#' @param k the order of ring neighbors. 0 is the focal location (the observed H3 index). 1 is the immediate neighbors of the H3 index. 2 is the neighbors of the 1st order neighbors and so on.
#' @param safe default `TRUE`. If `FALSE` uses the fast algorithm which can fail.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' - `grid_disk()`: returns the disk of cells for the identified K ring. It is a disk because it returns all cells to create a complete geometry without any holes. See `grid_ring()` if you do not want inclusive neighbors.
#' - `grid_ring()`: returns a K ring of neighbors around the H3 cell.
#' - `grid_distances()`: returns a list of numeric vectors indicating the network distances between neighbors in a K ring. The first element is always 0 as the travel distance to one's self is 0. If the H3 index is missing a 0 length vector will be returned.
#' - `grid_path_cells()`: returns a list of `H3` vectors indicating the cells traversed to get from `x` to `y`. If either `x` or `y` are missing, an empty vector is returned.
#' - `grid_path_cells_size()`: returns an integer vector with the cell path distance between pairwise elements of `x` and `y`. If either x or y are missing the result is `NA`.
#' `grid_distance()`: returns an integer vector with the network distance between pairwise elements of `x` and `y`. If either x or y are missing the result is `NA`. Effectively `grid_path_cells_size() - 1`.
#' - `grid_local_ij()` returns a two column data frame containing the columns `i` and `j` which correspond to the i,j coordinate directions to the destination cell.
